One of the most common misconceptions in React is the statement: "Components re-render when their props change." While this sounds logical, it's not entirely accurate. Let's explore how React re-renders actually work and debunk this myth.

## The Basics: What Triggers a Re-render?

The initial source of all re-renders in React is **state changes**. When a state update occurs, React will re-render the component where the state lives AND all its nested components, regardless of their props.

Let's see a simple example:

```jsx
const Child = () => {
  console.log("Child component renders");
  return <div>I'm a child</div>;
}

const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
      <Child />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Every time you click the button, the `Child` component will re-render even though it receives no props! You can verify this by checking the console logs.

## The Props Myth in Action

Let's modify our example to pass a prop that doesn't change:

```jsx
const Child = ({ text }) => {
  console.log("Child component renders");
  return <div>{text}</div>;
}

const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
      <Child text="I never change" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `Child` component will still re-render on every button click, even though its `text` prop never changes. This demonstrates that prop changes alone don't determine whether a component re-renders.

## When Do Props Matter?

Props only matter for re-renders when a component is wrapped in `React.memo`:

```jsx
const Child = React.memo(({ text }) => {
  console.log("Child component renders");
  return <div>{text}</div>;
});

const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
      <Child text="I never change" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now the `Child` component will only re-render if its props change. Since we're passing a static string, it won't re-render when the parent's state changes.

## Real World Example: Optimizing a Form

Here's a practical example of how understanding re-renders can help optimize performance:

```jsx
const ExpensiveComponent = () => {
  // Imagine this component does heavy calculations
  console.log("Expensive render");
  return <div>I'm expensive to render!</div>;
}

// ❌ Bad: ExpensiveComponent will re-render on every keystroke
const Form = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");
  
  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <ExpensiveComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

// ✅ Good: Move state to a separate component
const Input = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");
  
  return (
    <input 
      value={text}
      onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}

const BetterForm = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Input />
      <ExpensiveComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the optimized version, typing in the input won't cause `ExpensiveComponent` to re-render because the state changes are isolated in the `Input` component.

## Key Takeaways

1. State changes trigger re-renders, not prop changes
2. When a component re-renders, all its children re-render by default
3. `React.memo` makes components check their props before re-rendering
4. Moving state down the component tree can prevent unnecessary re-renders

Understanding these concepts helps write more performant React applications without premature optimization.
