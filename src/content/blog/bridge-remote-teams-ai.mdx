After years leading remote teams, I've learned that success isn't just about technical tools - it's about fostering genuine human connections. This insight led me to develop Bridge, an application that uses AI to strengthen bonds in distributed teams.

## The Distance Challenge

Remote work is here to stay, but maintaining cohesive teams across distances remains challenging. Spontaneous office conversations have disappeared, and video calls tend to focus solely on work tasks.

## The Solution: Automated Meaningful Conversations 

Bridge uses AI to generate personalized icebreakers based on:
- Team size
- Professional roles
- Personal interests
- Current group dynamics

Questions integrate seamlessly with Slack or other communication platforms, enabling natural conversations in the team's usual channels.

## Technology with Purpose

To quickly validate this solution, I chose:
- React 19 for frontend, leveraging Server Components
- Supabase as serverless backend
- Feedback system to improve AI suggestions

## Tangible Results

In my experience leading teams, these planned yet natural interactions have improved:
- Cross-departmental communication
- Sense of belonging
- Collaborative project productivity

## Next Steps

Bridge is under development as an MVP. If you lead a remote team and are interested in testing it, [contact me](#) for early access.

The code will be available on GitHub soon, building in public to receive community feedback.
