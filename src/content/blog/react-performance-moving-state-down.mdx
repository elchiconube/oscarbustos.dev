# Improving React Performance with the "Moving State Down" Pattern

One of the biggest challenges when building scalable React applications is maintaining optimal performance as the application grows. A common issue is that small state changes can trigger unnecessary re-renders across large portions of your app.

## The Big Re-renders Myth in React

There's a widespread misconception in the React world: "A component re-renders when its props change." This simply isn't true.

React's normal behavior is that when a state update is triggered, React will re-render **all nested components** regardless of their props. And if a state update is not triggered, then changing props will be "swallowed" - React doesn't monitor them.

This behavior is important because it means we need to be strategic about **where** we place our state in the component hierarchy.

## The Problem: Unnecessary Re-renders

Imagine an application where you have a button that opens a modal. The simplest implementation would look something like this:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div className="layout">
      <Button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>
        Open dialog
      </Button>
      
      {isOpen ? (
        <ModalDialog onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)} />
      ) : null}
      
      <VerySlowComponent />
      <BunchOfStuff />
      <OtherStuffAlsoComplicated />
    </div>
  );
};
